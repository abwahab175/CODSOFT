Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at # Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

# PROJECT

# 1

Titanic Survival prediction : This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, data analysis, and build the machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

# 2

Movie Rating Prediction : In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

# 3

Iris Flower Classification : The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
